<p>At my old complex the water sewage and trash service together was always about 40. If the color appears in the bowl you have a toilet leak that is literally flushing water down the drain. My apartment building also decided a year or two ago that they werent making enough money so now every unit gets a share of the common area electric bill which is frankly complete and utter bullshit but it adds about 25 a month. Trash and Trash Valet. Water Bills To Be Based On Actual Consumption In Each Apartment.</p>
