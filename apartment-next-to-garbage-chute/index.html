<p>The garbage chute I can hear people tossing out garbage once in a while but again it doesnt bother me and its not very loud at all. I agree with others that noise odors and overall foot-traffic near your unit especially in the age of COVID would be some issues that would worry me in terms of an actual purchase. My bathroom shares a wall with the garbage chute room and I have noticed the smell of the garbage has been leaking into my bathroom. This apartment is right next to the garbage chute had the real estate broker told Maria Kearney the British new resident of a building.
